Our Values
1. Freedom of Speech. Love speech needs no protection. We will endeavor to allow all to use this platform to freely express themselves to all who will hear them. The expression of 'hate speech' is an indication of free speech. The option to speak anonymously is a requirement for free speech.
2. Freedom of Association. Freedom of speech offers no guarrantee of an audience. We believe that everyone has the right to associate or not associate with other as they choose. This platform will strive to enable users to filter the content and the other users that they choose to not see.
3. Egalitarianism. We are all equal participants. There will be no moderators or administrators. We will each have the same abilities within the features of the platform. There will be no special status or designations associated with individual or groups of users. All users will be able to participate equaly in characterizing content and comments. These crowd-sourced characterizations will provide the context onwhich individual user's filter and sort settings will work to exclude and order content and comments.
4. Transparency. This platform is open source so the software can be examined and validated by anyone who wishes to do so. Furthermore, others are free to use the source code, with or without modification, to deploy and host their own private or public instances.
5. Free of advertisements. We believe that there is sufficient public interest in the sustenance and promotion of these values that sufficient funding will be willingly provided. All funding will be through anonymous donation. Donors will not recieve any special recognition or consideration because of their donations.
